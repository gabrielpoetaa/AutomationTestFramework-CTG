# Automation Test Framework

Hi,
this is an exercise I did for CTG ([Comunidade Tester Global](https://viniciuspessoni.com/comunidade-tester-global-b/)) where we were asked to automate some tests in a microservice API. Framework used: Java, RestAssured, Graddle and Junit5. 

In this framework we used Java, RestAssured, Graddle and Junit5 to program a microservice (API) testing.
